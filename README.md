# SteganographicEncoder
Inserting a Cryptographic Message within an Image

The Program has two Inputs:
The Image: A PNG Image of 256x256 pixels
The Message: A String

The Program Outputs Three Objects:
The Original Image: For Comparison Purposes
The Encoded Image: The Actual Output
The Message read from The Encoded Image: For Debugging Purposes

The Message does undergo basic Cryptographic techniques, which can be easily changed to a more robust method
